## Recreating This Challenge

### 2. Configure WordPress
- Access the administration page using default credentials.
- Create multiple posts.
- In one of the posts, hide the flag using the HTML or code section.
- Add a comment containing the flag:
  ```html
  <!-- FLAG{Wordpress-exploit-flag} -->
  ```

### 3. Create Docker Image and Push to Docker Hub
- Create a Docker image of the WordPress instance and the MariaDB container.

### 4. Create Docker Compose File
- Write a `docker-compose.yml` file that pulls the same instance of the challenge.
